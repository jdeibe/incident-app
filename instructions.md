# Interactive Incident App - PRD

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an interactive incident app, designed to enhance customer support by enabling users to efficiently manage and track support cases. The app will be built using Next.js 14, shadcn UI component library, Tailwind CSS, Mongoose for MongoDB interaction, and Lucid Icons for visual elements.

## Goals

Provide a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting incidents.
Enable efficient sorting, searching, and pagination of incidents.
Ensure a responsive and performant application.
Maintain a clean and well-documented codebase for future development and maintenance.

### Target Users

Customer support agents and other personnel responsible for managing and resolving customer issues.

### Functional Requirements

Incident Listing:

- Display a list of incidents in a grid format.
- Sorting: Allow users to sort incidents by any column (e.g., date created, priority, status).
- Pagination: Implement pagination to handle large numbers of incidents efficiently.
- Data Source: Fetch incident data from a MongoDB database.

### Incident Creation:

- Provide a form for creating new incidents.
- The form should be modular and easy to use.
- Include fields for relevant incident information (e.g., customer name, description, priority, status).

### Incident Management:

- Updating: Allow users to update existing incident details.
- Deletion: Enable users to delete incidents.

## API:

Develop an API with the following endpoints:

CREATE: /api/incidents (POST)
READ: /api/incidents (GET) and /api/incidents/[incidentId] (GET)
UPDATE: /api/incidents/[incidentId] (PUT)
DELETE: /api/incidents/[incidentId] (DELETE)

## Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: The application should load quickly and respond smoothly to user interactions.
Scalability: The application should be able to handle a growing number of incidents and users.
Security: Appropriate measures should be implemented to protect sensitive data.
Usability: The application should have a clear and intuitive user interface.
Accessibility: The application should be accessible to users with disabilities.

## Technical Specifications

Frontend: Next.js 14, shadcn, Tailwind CSS, Lucid Icons
Backend: Node.js, Express.js (if needed for API routing)
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
API: RESTful API

## Docker

Make the app work in docker and docker compose examples how to run the app.

## Documentation

Code Comments
Clear and concise comments should be used throughout the codebase to explain the purpose and functionality of different sections.
JSDoc
Use JSDoc to document functions, classes, and components, providing descriptions, parameters, and return values.
README.md
A comprehensive README file should be included in the root directory, providing:

## Project overview and goals

Installation instructions
API documentation
Contribution guidelines
Deployment instructions

## Testing

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual components and functions to ensure they work as expected.
Integration Tests: Conduct integration tests to verify the interaction between different components and the API.
End-to-End Tests: Perform end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and ensure the entire application functions correctly.

## Deployment

The application should be deployed to a suitable hosting environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines should be set up to automate the build, testing, and deployment process.

This detailed PRD provides a clear roadmap for developers to implement the interactive incident app. By adhering to the specifications outlined in this document, the development team can ensure the successful delivery of a high-quality and user-friendly application that meets the needs of the customer support team.
